## What is an annual subscription?
An **annual subscription** is a billing model where a customer pays once for a full year of access to a product or service—usually at a lower effective rate than monthly billing. It’s popular with SaaS, DTC brands, and streaming services because it improves revenue predictability and retention.

## Why offer it?
- **Higher LTV** and **lower churn**
- **Upfront cash flow** and better forecasting
- Easy to sweeten with **discounts**, **exclusive content**, or **gifts**

## Annual vs Monthly (quick view)
- **Billing cadence:** once per year vs every month  
- **Commitment:** longer-term vs flexible  
- **Pricing:** annual often **discounted** (e.g., “save 15%”)  
- **Behavior:** annual users are **less likely to cancel mid-year**

## Example
A skincare brand sells:
- **Monthly:** $25/month  
- **Annual:** $240/year (**20% off**)

A customer chooses annual, pays upfront, saves money, and stays subscribed all year.

## Driftcharge Tip
Offer both monthly and annual plans. Use clear savings or unique perks to nudge users to annual.
